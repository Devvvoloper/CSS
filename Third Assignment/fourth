Q.4) Add the box-sizing property to content box.
What changes did you notice?
-> The content itself is changing it's height and width equivalent to keys; No padding and border adjusted in the content. Header and Footer size change is observed. Total height earlier = content + padding + border = height. But now content itself = 200px. Total height is greater than 200 px.
